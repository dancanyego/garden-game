    "- tend(): This method allows the gardener to tend to their plants. It prompts the user to select a plant from their planted plants, then calls the grow() method on that plant.\n",
    "- harvest(): This method allows the gardener to harvest a plant. It prompts the user to select a plant from their planted plants, then calls the harvest() method on that plant. It then adds the harvest yield to the gardener's inventory.\n",
